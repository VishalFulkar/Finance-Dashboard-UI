## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisite
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
* Running [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) cluster or a local MongoDB community instance

### Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd "FinFlow"

# Install backend dependencies
cd Backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../Frontend
npm install
```

### Step 2: Environment Configurations
Create a `.env` file in the **`Backend/`** folder:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.xxxx.mongodb.net/finance-dashboard
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
```

### Step 3: Run the Servers
Open two terminal windows to run both servers concurrently:

**Terminal 1 (Backend Dev Server)**:
```bash
cd Backend
npm run dev
# Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend React App)**:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
# Starts on http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔒 Security Practices Done Right
* **HTTP-Only Cookies**: JWT auth tokens are assigned via `httpOnly` cookies with `sameSite: 'lax'` configurations, effectively mitigating standard **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and **CSRF** threats.
* **Route Guards**:
  * `ProtectedRoute`: Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.
  * `AuthRoute`: Blocks authenticated users from returning to Login/Register pages.
* **Isolated User Scope**: Backend validation guarantees that a user can only perform read/write/delete tasks on transaction records bound strictly to their user ID.
